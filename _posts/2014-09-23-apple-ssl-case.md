<p>
	The point is clearly about programming practice. In February 2014, 
	<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/25/apples-ssl-iphone-vulnerability-how-did-it-happen-and-what-next">Apple faced an SSL bug</a>. This was a very simple code mistake due to 	conditional sequences.
</p>
<p>
	Because of the conditional aspect, we easily focus on curly braces. Two comments suggested the solution to such a problem could be about test cases (both articles provide simple code extracts of the guilty section):

	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	For sure, testing is an important point in code quality. In an ideal world there would be a test case for any code piece. For sure, there are excellent other tools. I previously wrote about <a href="http://bdulac.github.io/note/design-by-contract-assertions-and-exceptions/">design by contract</a>.  
	<span itemprop="citation" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ScholarlyArticle">

		is also an important topic.

	I won't say any practice is inappropriate.

	Stop dreaming about a world with perfect programs. Let the code verification/prove apart and come back to the code. Adam Langley also suggests code reviews are important. Curly braces ? Perhaps the point isn't central. What matter is a <span itemprop="about">readable code</span>, and others point of view. Many programmers write endless code sequences. What could be the solution ?
</p> 
<p>
	We, French people, tend to be very verbose in our texts. At school, we are taught to be concise. We do not succeed in any case. How would it be possible in code ? Think about <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/counting-characters">Twitter 140 characters</a>. Just think about what a French journalists  <a href="http://www.slate.fr/story/41689/140-signes-twitter-fin-google">could write in 2011</a>. Nowadays, very few journalist still criticize the system. Conciseness can be very useful.

	Why don't compilers warn when a function exceeds 100 lines (or any number that suits you) ?
