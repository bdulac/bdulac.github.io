	"Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about
	telescopes" said <a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/17820452">Edsger
		Dijkstra</a>.

<p>&nbsp;I have always been interested in the two sides of
	computing:</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Calculus</li>
	<li>Information processing</li>
</ul>
In the early ages of computing, we tend to focus on the first machines
and their calculus properties.
<a href="http://viaf.org/viaf/4963723">Charles Babbage</a>
inventions are famous.

	But in the early 19th century, the pioneer was also interested in
	information processing and transactions. Reading <a
		href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1831407.1831417">an article</a>, I
	discovered he described the processes involving bank transactions in <a
		href="http://books.google.fr/books/about/On_the_Economy_of_Machinery_and_Manufact.html?id=4QWZq4FDoH4C">one
		of his works</a>.
