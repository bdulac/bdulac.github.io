</span><em>Polymer</em> is a very interesting move by Google promoting in some way a W3C work: 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/">Web components</a>. I try to sum up here all I learned from <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/tutorial/intro.html">the <em>Polymer</em> tutorial</a>.
</p>
<p>
What is the relationship between Web components (as a W3C recommendation) and the <a href="http://polymer-project.org/"><em>Polymer</em> project</a> (as lead by Google) ? In a few words, <em>Polymer</em> bridges the gap between the work pending in the frame of the recommendation working group and the features implemented by browsers. This is done via a simple Javascript, <em>platform.js</em>.
</p>
<p>
Web components are custom HTML tags. <b>How is the behavior and rendering of such elements defined ?</b>
</p>
<p>
The components definition relies on another W3C recommendation, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-imports/">HTML imports</a>. Introduced as a new <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/links.html#linkTypes">link type</a>, <em>import</em>, the principle is simple. This allows to include an external resource into an HTML resource. The practice for Web components is to use these included resources to define the behavior.
</p>
<p>
The negative point in using <em>Polymer</em> is that, probably because of the ongoing draft recommendation process, components definition requires the use of a <em>Polymer</em>-specific tag. I guess things should evolve here. The problem is that:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	If the definition of components becomes standard, <em>Polymer</em>-written components will have to be adapted (a slightest pain if the tag has just to be removed)
	</li>
	<li>
	If the definition of components stays an implementation-specific feature, Web components will be a real mess
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the introduction, <link itemprop="sameAs" href="#bidelman">Bidelman</link> states that every framework is compatible with DOM. Indeed, as a result of the document structure simplification induced by Web components, this is a huge change in the way information is provided on the Web. This won't change so much for end users in the first place.
</p>
<p>
On a software engineering point of view, the step could be a real revolution: information provided by the Web server could have a same structure for a Web browser and for any software client. HTML would really look like an XML document, except for the head imports.
</p>
<p>
What will make the real success of Web components is the behavior of software giants. And with <em>Polymer</em>, Google seems to be seriously involved. Could it be a serious move to use Web standards in replacement of any Android API challenged by the <a href="http://www.google.fr/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCEQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FOracle_v._Google&ei=GoNPVJr-KIfeaM69gsgJ&usg=AFQjCNGcs0490Akq-aklYP09IHZlns9imA&bvm=bv.77880786,d.d2s">Oracle lawsuit</a> ? Perhaps the end of the mobile native / Web apps dichotomy ? Is it a dream ? Still a long way to go for involved engineers, but so many promises...
