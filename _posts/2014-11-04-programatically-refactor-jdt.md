Using the internal <a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui.git/plain/org.eclipse.jdt.ui/core%20refactoring/org/eclipse/jdt/internal/corext/refactoring/rename/">rename package</a> is not a very good idea (discouraged access warning). There is an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/article.php?file=Article-Unleashing-the-Power-of-Refactoring/index.html">official documentation</a> on that topic. A <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/9129689/1207019">stackoverflow exchange</a> also mentions interesting informations.
