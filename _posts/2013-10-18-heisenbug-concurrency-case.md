title: Heisenbug - Concurrency case
---

<p>Solving an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger">Heisenbug</a> can be really tricky. This kind of bugs occur when the program execution conditions are changing. In many cases, using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger">debugger</a> or a log output doesn't help. Such tools can have an influence on the execution.</p><p></p><p>I once faced such a bug in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Swing">Swing</a> application. The problem occurred in a quite long process (half an hour)&nbsp; at various steps with constant input data. I lost time with that bug because I had no methodology. I have to admit the solution is really simple.</p><p></p><p>I simply designed an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_diagram">activity diagram</a> of the main activities of the process. I paid attention to swimlanes because I suspected a concurrency problem. For each activity there was a single log output. A custom logging level was set up so that only activity logs could be written (an attempt with the debug level logs was completely helpless). The logging framework was also configured to print the current thread name. There I got the activity which was not in the right place and the name of the criminal. The random occurrence of the problem was probably due to the system load and user interactions.</p>
