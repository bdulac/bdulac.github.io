title: ! 'Point of view: MVC frameworks'
---

<p>After some (bad) experiences, I am quite sceptical about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a> frameworks.</p><p>The hall of fame has accepted a few names: <a href="http://struts.apache.org/">Struts</a>, <a href="http://www.playframework.com/">Play</a>, <a href="https://wicket.apache.org/">Wicket</a>... And then ? </p><p>Each period has its champion. Struts, as one of the elders, had a long period. So many developers had to use it. But what about software maintenance and evolutions ? Starting with Struts 1, who had to move to version 2 ? What about moving to another technology ?</p><p>Quite a nightmare, it is sometimes easier to rewrite completely the application.</p><p>In my point of view, long term solutions rely directly on the Java platform. </p><p>The classic <a href="https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr315/">Servlet</a> / <a href="https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr245/">JSP</a>&nbsp;tandem is not an MVC implementation but is plain and simple and evolutions are easy.</p><p>I understand <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=314">JSF</a> enthusiasts. The solution is modern and interesting on a productivity point of view. I have a personal problem with JSF (and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ei-rbULWoA#t=47m">others</a> share my opinion) : JSF and JSP are bad companions. What a shame for two specifications...</p><p>While the RESTful architectural style is trendy, the idea of integrating <a href="https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=339">JAX-RS</a> and JSPs is interesting (<a href="https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/mvc.html">part</a> of <a href="https://jersey.java.net/">Jersey</a>). Hope it will be part of the core specification someday.</p>
