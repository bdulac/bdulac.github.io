This is a technical Blog written by Bérenger Dulac.

I define myself primarily as a software developer. Not to be exclusive, my main activity focus on the Java platform (Swing + Web).

In the everyday, I largely use online documentations, blogs, forum posts. Until now, I did not contributed anything.

In this blog I will try to sum up the useful subjects I crossed.

The blog is rendered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) using the [Thinny theme](http://camporez.com).
