My name is BÃ©renger Dulac, this website is my personal technical blog. I define myself primarily 
as a software developer. Not to be exclusive, my main activity focus on the Java platform 
(Swing + Web).
</p>
<p>
In the everyday, I largely use online documentations, blogs, forum posts. Until now, I did not 
contributed anything.
</p>
<p>
In this blog I will try to sum up the useful subjects I crossed.

The blog is rendered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> with a template derived from the <a href="http://camporez.com">Thinny theme</a>.
