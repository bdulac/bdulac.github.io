My name is BÃ©renger Dulac, this website contains my personal technical notes. I define myself primarily as a software developer. Not to be exclusive, my main activity focus on the Java platform (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development">Web</a> + <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_%28Java%29">Swing</a>).
</p>
<p>
In the everyday, I largely use online documentations, blogs, forum posts. After many years without contributing anything, perhaps is it time to share some elements. In this site I try day after day to sum up the useful subjects I cross. This <em>notepad</em> mixes technical elements and personal opinions.
</p>
<p><a href="../categories/">Categories</a> group the notes by topic. Blog posts are personal opinions available in the <a href="{{ site.url }}">general index</a>. Each post is related to its categories displayed in the footer, with links when general notes are available.
</p>
<p>
Because I know that there is a plenty of informations on the Web and that reading can be long, important points are <b>emphasized</b>. This is not to be rude, but rather to save the reader's time.

The site is rendered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> with a template derived from the <a href="http://camporez.com">Thinny theme</a>.
