My name is Bérenger Dulac, this website is my personal technical blog. I define myself primarily 
as a software developer. Not to be exclusive, my main activity focus on the Java platform 
(<a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development">Web</a> + <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_%28Java%29">Swing</a>).
</p>
<p>
In the everyday, I largely use online documentations, blogs, forum posts. After many years without contributing anything, perhaps is it time to share some elements.
</p>
<p>
In this blog I try to sum up the useful subjects I cross. The posts are accessible in the general index or in categories accessible from the footer.
</p>
<p>
These category pages are detailing a subject. Each individual page don't try to be a documentation, only a gathering of relative posts enriched with some static content.

The blog is rendered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> with a template derived from the <a href="http://camporez.com">Thinny theme</a>.
