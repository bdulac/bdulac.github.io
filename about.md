My name is BÃ©renger Dulac, this website is my personal technical blog. I define myself primarily 
as a software developer. Not to be exclusive, my main activity focus on the Java platform 
(Swing + Web).
</p>
<p>
In the everyday, I largely use online documentations, blogs, forum posts. After many years without contributing anything, perhaps is it time to share some elements.
</p>
<p>
In this blog I try to sum up the useful subjects I cross. Informations are organized in two categories:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Blog posts</li>
	<li>Individual pages</li>
</ul>
<p>The pages are technical notes grouped by subject. Each individual page don't try to be a documentation, only elements noted when crossed.</p>
<p>
The blog is rendered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> with a template derived from the <a href="http://camporez.com">Thinny theme</a>.
