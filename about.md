My name is BÃ©renger Dulac, this website contains my personal technical notes. I define myself primarily as a software developer. Not to be exclusive, my main activity focus on the Java platform (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development">Web</a> + <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_%28Java%29">Swing</a>).
</p>
<p>
In the everyday, I largely use online documentations, blogs, forum posts. After many years without contributing anything, perhaps is it time to share some elements.
</p>
<p>
In this site I try to sum up the useful subjects I cross. <a href="../categories/">Categories</a> group the notes by topic. Blog posts are personal opinions accessible in the general index. Each post is related to its categories displayed in the footer, with links when general notes are available.

The blog is rendered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> with a template derived from the <a href="http://camporez.com">Thinny theme</a>.
