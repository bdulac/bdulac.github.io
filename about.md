My name is Bérenger Dulac, I currently work as a software engineer at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Natural_History_%28France%29"><em>Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle</em></a> (MNHN, Paris). This website contains my personal technical notes. Not to be exclusive, my main activity focus on the <em>Java</em> platform (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development">Web</a> + <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_%28Java%29">Swing</a>).
</p>
<p>
In the everyday, I largely use online documentations, blogs, forum posts. After many years without contributing anything, perhaps is it time to share some elements. A first initiative was to use my <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1207019/bdulac">Stackoverflow account</a> which had been idle for a while. In this site I try to sum up day after day the useful subjects I cross. This <em>notepad</em> mixes technical elements and personal opinions.
</p>
<p><a href="../categories/">Categories</a> group the notes by topic. Blog posts are available in the <a href="{{ site.url }}">general index</a>. Each post is related to its categories displayed in the footer, with links when general notes are available. Several of these posts express personal opinions, these are grouped under a <a href="../point-of-view/">specific category</a>.
</p>
<p>
Because I know there is a plenty of informations on the Web and reading can be long, important points are <b>emphasized</b>. This is not to be rude, but rather to save the reader's time.

The site is rendered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"><em>Jekyll</em></a> with a template derived from the <a href="http://camporez.com">Thinny theme</a>.
