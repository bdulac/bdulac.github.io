I once saw an online content explaining that software engineering is not engineering because it is not innovative, at least in most cases (sorry for the missing hyperlink but I don't find the reference). This is probably true, and a right software developer should not try to be excessively innovative just to prove he is an engineer. Making things simple is really important. At first glance, this is a kind of paradox. When it comes to software, things tends to be perceived as complex. But this is a misconception: indeed, software involve very large sets of components. Each one is individually rarely sophisticated.

This introduction does not mean that software engineering is not central: only that the term is perhaps inappropriate. The elements are key concepts of software and should always come before code. I think that programming is more about what is called software engineering than about code. Not because of any kind of complexity, because of the numerous tenants involved.
