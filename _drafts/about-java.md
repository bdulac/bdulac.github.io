This post is going to seem dumb to Java developers. But in my point of view the question is not really plain and simple.<br />
<br />
The topic is: what is Java ? (How is it defined ? By who ?)<br />
<br />
Java is the trademark of a software platform consisting in three sets of elements:<br />
<ol>
<li>A programming language</li>
<li>A virtual machine (JVM)</li>
<li>Runtime environments (JRE and others)</li>
</ol>
All three are defined in specifications<br />
JCP + specifications = answer(JSR)<br />
<br />
Runtime environments are declined in three versions (Java ME, Java SE and Java EE)
