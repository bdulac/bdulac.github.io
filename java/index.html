	<p>In a few words, what is Java ?</p>
	<p>Java is the trademark of a software platform consisting in three
		sets of elements:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>A programming language</li>
		<li>A virtual machine (JVM)</li>
		<li>Runtime environments (JRE and others)</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Each component of the platform is defined by a specification. 
		Different implementations of the specifications allow the support of 
		Java programs in multiple environments.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Java platform components where iniated by 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a>. 
		They currently evolve in the frame of the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Community_Process">JCP</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The JCP members ask for new specifications: they propose a 
		<a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/overview">JSR</a>. After approval, 
		the JCP forms an expert group to work on the JSR. A final relase is 
		obtained with a Reference Implementation (RI) and a Technology 
		Conformance Kit (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Compatibility_Kit">TCK</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		Runtime environments are declined in three versions: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Java Micro Edition (Java ME)</li>
		<li>Java Standard Edition (Java SE)</li>
		<li><a href="ee">Java Enterpise Edition (Java EE)</a></li>
	</ul>
