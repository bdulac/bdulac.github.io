In a few words, what is Java ?
</p>
<p>
Java is the trademark of a software platform consisting in three sets of 
elements:
</p>
<ol>
<li>A programming language</li>
<li>A virtual machine (JVM)</li>
<li>Runtime environments (JRE and others)</li>
</ol>
<p>
All three are defined in specifications
JCP + specifications = answer(JSR)

Runtime environments are declined in three versions (Java ME, Java SE and 
Java EE)
