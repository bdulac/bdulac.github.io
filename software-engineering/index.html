I once saw an online content explaining that software engineering is not 
engineering because it is not innovative, at least in most cases (sorry for the missing 
hyperlink but I don't find the reference). This is probably true, and a right 
software developer should not try to be excessively innovative just 
to prove he is an engineer. Making things simple is really important. This 
introduction does not mean that software engineering is not central: only that 
the term is perhaps inappropriate. The elements are key concepts of 
software and should always come before code. This is perhaps a paradox but I 
think that programming is more about software engineering than about code.
